###Brochure Site

Redesigned brochure site that was optimized solely for SEO and acquisition to a site that served to education users on  what the product offered, the benefits to the consumer and what to expect as a customer. 
    
**Goal:**   
Do a better job of educating visitors about the product before signup  to increase 30 day trials while reducing post trial cancelation rates.  Deliver a more professional look and feel. 

**Results:**  
Through testing, we discovered that showing the actual product via screenshots and video performed best. Decrease in cancelation rates.

**Solution:**
 
- Referred copywriter to work with Marketing team on messaging strategy
- Worked closely with marketing and copy to create a design that best supported the messaging 
- Responsible for entire look and feel, all the creative assets, including several explorations of hero graphics, iconography, and screenshots
- Produced and narrated educational video
