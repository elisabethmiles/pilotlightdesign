================
###Phase I
Research showed that customers get the most value from Outright if they link an external business account, thus automating their finances. 

**Goal:** Design a guided set up flow from the marketing site that was optimized for linking external bank accounts. 

**Results:**  
30%-35% Activation Rate

**Solution:** We built and tested 2 interactive prototypes to test with new users. The first prototype a single step interface. The second prototype was broken out into four separate steps based on the type of account. 
The assumption going into the tests was that less steps will be better. 

**Single step (Loser)**

**Four steps (Winner)**

####What worked? 
- **Specific Calls to Action.** "Add a Bank" was less confusing than "Add an Account"
- **Tasks were broken down into smaller pieces.** Even though this translated to more steps, each step was easy for the user to process and understand. 
- **No dead-ends in the UI.** This meant the user could always move forward or backward, alleviating any anxiety over being "stuck"

###Phase II
Based on the success of the first iteration of guided setup, we rolled this concept out to our supported eCommerce platforms, such as eBay and Etsy. 

**Goal:** Increase account activation for users coming from eCommerce platforms. 

**Results:** Activation rates range from 65% - 70%

**Solution:** Customized setup for new customers coming through partner channels such as eBay and Etsy. Recommended accounts to link based on channel.

###Self Identification  and account recommendation
Now that we had a winning formula, it was time to go back to our guided set up flow from the marketing site and apply what we learned. 

**Goal:** Increase account activation from Outright website. 


**Results:** Activation rate goes to 42% - 45%. An average increase in 9% in the first week. 
Overall increase in number of linked accounts on first day of sign up from 20% in Jan to 50% in Nov.

**Solution:** Allow new users to self select their "channel"
