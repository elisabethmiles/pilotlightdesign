================


This is the preview application to Outright's mvp iPhone application. The preview "app" will be a mobile version of the site using the Safari browser. This first release is for existing users only and will have a very limited feature set. Users will be able to see their profit and loss and sales for the year. They will also be able to see their account balances.      
    
**Goal:**   
To release to a select group of users and solicit feedback for future features.  

**Results:**  
Over all feedback on the preview was positive. We learned that users wanted to be able to track expenses, as well as add and edit transactions and were able to prioritize the next 3 release accordingly.
