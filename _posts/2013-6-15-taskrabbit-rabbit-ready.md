================


The old process for on-boarding new Rabbits into the marketplace long, manual, expensive.  The business needed a new scalable new process to onboard new TaskRabbits into the marketplace. My team was tasked with making that happen. 


**Goal:**   
To dramatically reduce on-boarding costs and time to marketplace for TaskRabbits. The on-boarding cost for each TaskRabbit was about estimated to be about $30 and the average time it took to become as TaskRabbit was about 2 weeks.

**Solution**

1. Ditch the application process altogether, instead incentivize TaskRabbits to build their profiles. When a TaskRabbit had built their profile up enough, they were able to bid on tasks in the marketplace. 

2. Stop using 3rd party solution for video interview. 

3. Background check is triggered once the TaskRabbit has become active in the marketplace, i.e. bid on a task. 

**Results**

* Reduced on-boarding costs from approximately $30 to $5. Reduced time to marketplace from 14 days to under 2 days.     

* Allowed the business hit on-boarding targets.  Primed the business for geographic expansion.  

* Letting TaskRabbits to add value to their profile in the way of adding media, such as video, showcasing their skills and interests, empowers them to market themselves.   

**The Details**  
As with most MVPs, though we some early success, we didn't hit right out of the gate the first time. I'll tell you the success story first. 

*Why don't you just email us your video?* We really wanted to get out of using a 3rd party service for the video interview. Not only was it costly, it was a large friction point among users and fraught with technical issues. We also this would be a great opportunity for new users to creatively market themselves on their profile. 

Building the a robust video feature wasn't very MVP, so we simply asked users to record a video and email it to us using the same account they signed up with. We weren't sure what to expect, but when the video's started rolling in we were pleasantly surprised. The quality and creativity surpassed anything we could have imagined.

*Great barriers to entry* While we loved the content coming in from our users, video was still proving to be the highest barrier to entry. It wasn't that people didn't want to create a video, but rather they wanted time to create the **right** video. We also knew the key to the success of Rabbit Ready was to get new TaskRabbits engaged with the marketplace early. Building your profile with a video couldn't be a gating factor. 

*Pimp my profile* Once we dropped video as a gating to entry, it forced us to think about ways to get new TaskRabbits to add value to their profiles. We thought the best way to do this would be to simply take new users directly to their profile page after they bid on a task. The problem? The existing profile page looked pretty dated and crummy. It needed some love. So we did just that by giving them a cosmetic makeover as well as making them friendly for mobile devices.
