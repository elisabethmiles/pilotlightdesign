================


KiwiCrate's new site The Studio allows users to browse hundreds of DIY children's projects with the ability to buy materials right there.

**Goal:**   
To quickly test and validate content and commerce with the Studio user base. We wanted to test the viability of selling individual materials online with the hypothesis that showcasing featured projects with the material would help promote sales. 

**Solution**
Due to time and resource constraints, we decided to punt on building a separate item page, going instead with a single page design for the storefront. This required relying on popover interactions for item descriptions and featured projects.
