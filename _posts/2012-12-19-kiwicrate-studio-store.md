================


KiwiCrate's new site The Studio allows users to browse hundreds of DIY children's projects with the ability to buy materials right there.

**Goal:**   
To quickly test and validate content and commerce with the Studio user base. We wanted to test the viability of selling individual materials online with the hypothesis that showcasing featured projects with the material would help promote sales. 

**Solution**
In the spirit of keeping the scope of the project to an MVP, we decided to simplify things with a simple single page design for the storefront.   

**Results**
Based on results from the MVP, the internal team built the full version of the <a href="http://www.kiwicrate.com/diy-materials.html">Arts &amp; Crafts store </a>.
